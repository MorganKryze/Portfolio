            Ireland is a country that I've always wanted to visit. I had the
            chance to go there in 2019, and I fell in love with the landscapes,
            the people, and the culture. I can't wait to go back and explore
            more of this beautiful country.

            Sardegna is a beautiful island in the Mediterranean Sea. I had the
            chance to visit it in 2018, and I was amazed by the crystal-clear
            waters, the white sandy beaches, and the stunning landscapes. I
            can't wait to go back and explore more of this amazing island.

            France is a country that I've always loved. I had the chance to
            visit it in 2017, and I was amazed by the beautiful landscapes, the

            The tales of Rototo is a collection of short stories that I wrote
            during the lockdown. They are inspired by my travels and my
            imagination. I hope you enjoy reading them as much as I enjoyed
            writing them.
